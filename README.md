project:1 Salary-determening-System 

 This system try to solve the manual calculation of the netsalary,Gross salary and overtime earning .This system implemented using
 decorator design pattern because the rating range and the overtime time can be changed overtime.
 So six class of rate determiner in the decorator folder .so those separated class can incapsulate the detail 
 when the project get bigger and when change of requirement happen there is no change in main class (client) 
 so changes occur during runtime not compile time.
